#The game is played by two generals with their armies. Each general has an army of soldiers and a bag of gold coins.

Soldiers have:

military rank: Private (Score: 1), Corporal (Score: 2), Captain (Score: 3), and Major (Score: 4); experience; a soldier's strength is calculated as the product of his rank and experience the soldier dies when his experience = 0; if the experience reaches five times the tier value, he will advance to the next tier and his experience = 1. Generals have a starting (limited) amount of gold. The general's goal is to have the largest and best trained army possible.

The general can:

order maneuvers of your army (or part of it), which increase the experience of participating soldiers by 1; maneuvers cost: for each soldier participating in the maneuver, the general pays the value (number of coins) assigned to the military rank; attack the second general; the general who has the army with the greater total strength wins; the loser gives 10% of his gold to the winner; each soldier from the losing army loses 1 experience point, and from the winning army he gains one; in case of a tie, each general must shoot one of his randomly selected soldiers; buy soldiers; soldier cost = 10 *(his rank); purchased soldiers have experience = 1.
